# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm
The objective of this project is to develop four programs, implement same operations by each  one and then compare and analyze the performance of various data structures with respect to  various operations. This will be executed by initially storing the data of employees of a company  in a program and then performing insert, find, sorted traversal and deletion on the data using the  data structures linked list, hash table (quadratic probing), binary trees and arrays. For each  operation carried out, the execution time and memory consumption of the program will be  recorded.
